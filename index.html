        <h2>Welcome to Onigiring Pinoy!</h2>
        <p>Onigiring Pinoy is a homegrown food business that brings together the heart of Filipino flavors and the tradition of Japanese onigiri. Inspired by the classic rice snack from Ishikawa, Japan, our brand introduces a fresh and exciting twist by infusing it with well-loved Filipino dishes.</p>
        <h2>Our Concept</h2>
        <p>Onigiri comes from the Japanese word nigiru, which means “to hold.” Traditionally shaped by hand into a triangle or ball, it is designed for easy handling and mess-free eating. At Onigiring Pinoy, we keep this convenient format but reinvent the fillings to reflect Filipino taste and culture. ‎Each piece is made with premium Japanese rice, seasoned lightly, filled generously, wrapped in nori seaweed, topped with furikake flakes, and sealed with cling wrap to maintain freshness and shape.</p>
